BDO Game Launcher

This program is a launcher for the game Black Desert Online.   
  
It is simple to use, place it in your Black Desert game folder and run it.

There are some things you need to know when using this launcher:  
  
1. It must be run from the game install folder.
2. You must provide a user id and password. Depending on the game server your first use of a userid and password will create a new account or it must previously exist. This is controlled by the game server and not this launcher
3. The login host must be available. The login host information is taken from the service.ini file of the game folder. Host name can be either a url of an ip address. Port must be provided.

If all of the above is correct, you will see a 'Play' button appear and you can click that to launch your game.

You can mute the sound by clicking the little speaker icon in the upper left corner. You can change the launcher's background music by replacing the audio.mp3 file in the same folder containing the launcher with one of your own choosing. Delete that file and the default music will be re-created.

The language used for this launcher is English. To change it you will need to change all text strings in the program to your desired language.

This launcher is written c# under .NET v6.1. You need that level of .net installed to run it. Also this is a 64-bit application and will only run the 64-bit Black Desert client. It will not work for the 32-bit client.
